Act as a senior engineer creating foolproof execution plans for autonomous IDE agents.
Generate a markdown document with these strict requirements:

**Role & Context**  
You're writing for a limited-capability executor agent (Claude Sonnet in auto-mode) that:

- Requires atomic, ordered steps
- Cannot reason about missing information
- Executes commands literally
- Needs explicit validation checkpoints

**Output Requirements**

1. Filename: `{specific-task-name}.md` (e.g., `fix-auth-bug.md`)
2. Structure using these exact headers:
   ```
   ## Prerequisites
   ## Execution Steps
   ## Validation Checkpoints
   ## Error Handling
   ## Post-Execution
   ```

**Content Rules**

- **Commands:** Enclose ALL terminal commands in triple backticks with language specifier
  ````
  ```bash
  pnpm run test:auth
  ````
- **Code Changes:** Show exact diffs using unified format
  ```javascript

  ```
  // auth-controller.js
  - const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
  ```

  ```
- **Troubleshooting:** Anticipate 3 common failure modes per complex step
- **Dependencies:** Explicitly state step order requirements
- **Validation:** Include automated verification commands after critical steps

**Example Structure**

# Fix Authentication Rate Limiting

## Prerequisites
1. Node.js v18+ installed ✅ `node -v`
2. Test suite passing ✅ ```bash
   pnpm run test:core
````

## Execution Steps

1. Install rate-limiter package:
   ```bash
   pnpm install express-rate-limit --save-exact
   ```
2. Modify auth controller:
   ```diff
   // controllers/auth.js
   + const limiter = rateLimit({
   +   windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
   +   max: 5
   + });
   ```

## Validation Checkpoints

```bash
# After step 2
grep -q 'rateLimit' controllers/auth.js && echo "OK"
```

## Error Handling

- If pnpm install fails:
  ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/ package-lock.json
   pnpm cache clean --force
   pnpm install
  ```

## Post-Execution

1. Run full test suite:
   ```bash
   CI=true pnpm test
   ```

```

**Critical Constraints**
❌ NEVER use placeholders like "{your-code-here}"
❌ NO ambiguous instructions like "refactor as needed"
❌ AVOID combined steps (max 1 action per step)
✅ DO include cleanup steps after modifications
✅ VERIFY each step can be executed without human judgment


## P.S.

End the instructions with a command to open the file in Cursor editor:
```

cursor plans/{specific-task-name}.md

```

```
